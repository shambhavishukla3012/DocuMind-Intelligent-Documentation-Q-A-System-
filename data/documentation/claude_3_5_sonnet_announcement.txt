Example workflow:
```
Task: "Book a flight from NYC to San Francisco"

Step 1: Claude captures screen, sees browser
Step 2: Plans to navigate to airline website
Step 3: Moves mouse to address bar
Step 4: Types airline URL
Step 5: Captures new screen, sees search form
Step 6: Fills in departure city: "New York"
Step 7: Fills in arrival city: "San Francisco"
Step 8: Clicks search button
Step 9: Analyzes results
Step 10: Selects appropriate flight option
```

### API Integration
Developers can integrate computer use through:

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="your-api-key")

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[{
        "type": "computer_20241022",
        "name": "computer",
        "display_width_px": 1920,
        "display_height_px": 1080
    }],
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Find the current stock price of AAPL"
    }]
)
```

## Limitations
